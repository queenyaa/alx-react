### Introduction
---

#### **Normalizr**

- **Purpose**: Normalizr is used to normalize nested JSON data into a flat structure, making it easier to manage and manipulate.
- **Schemas**: Define entities and their relationships to describe the data structure. Examples include defining user, article, and comment schemas.
- **Normalization**: Using schemas to convert nested JSON into a normalized form.
- **Usage**: Integrate Normalizr with state management libraries like Redux to store and access normalized data efficiently.

#### **Core Concepts of Redux**

1. **Store**: The single source of truth that holds the application state.
2. **State**: The entire state of the application, represented as a plain JavaScript object.
3. **Actions**: Plain objects that describe what happened; they must have a `type` property.
4. **Action Creators**: Functions that return action objects to ensure consistency.
5. **Reducers**: Pure functions that take the current state and an action, returning a new state.
6. **Dispatch**: A method to send actions to the store.
7. **Selectors**: Functions that extract specific pieces of information from the state.
8. **Middleware**: Extends Redux with custom functionality, commonly used for handling asynchronous actions (e.g., logging, async operations).
9. **Combine Reducers**: Combines multiple reducers into a single reducer function for complex state management.
10. **Immutability**: Ensures state updates do not mutate the existing state but return new state objects.

#### **Redux Action Creators**

- **Purpose**: Functions that return action objects to provide a consistent way of creating actions.
- **Action Types**: Constants that define the types of actions.
- **Example**: Defined action creators for incrementing, decrementing, and setting a value in a counter application.
- **Usage in Reducers**: Reducers handle actions created by action creators to update the state.
- **Usage in React**: Integrated action creators with React components using React-Redux.

#### **Async Actions in Redux**

- **Middleware**: Redux Thunk is commonly used to handle async actions by allowing action creators to return functions (thunks).
- **Thunk**: A function that delays an action until later, typically for performing async operations.
- **Setup**: Install and apply Redux Thunk middleware to the Redux store.
- **Async Action Creators**: Functions that perform async operations (e.g., API calls) and dispatch actions based on the results.
- **Example**: Created async action creators to fetch user data from an API, handled actions in reducers, and connected them to React components using React-Redux.

By understanding these core concepts and their practical applications, you can effectively manage both synchronous and asynchronous state changes in your Redux applications.
